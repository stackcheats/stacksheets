## Stratagem

As out-of-the-box, the WSO2 API Manager supports adding and creating custom API properties. You can learn more about managing custom API properties from [here](https://docs.wso2.com/display/AM260/Adding+Custom+Properties+to+APIs). In this cheat, we will be looking at how to access these custom API properties from mediation sequences.

For demo, we have introduced a custom property named `transparent-token` in one of our published API, and we have a requirement to log this property in the logs whenever this API is invoked.

> **Quick Note** 
> 
> The following illustrations are developed considering an All-In-One deployment environment of the API Manager server. In a distributed environment, the Gateway component will not have access to the registry space of the Publisher component unless it is shared and configured under the `master-datasources.xml` and `registry.xml`.

<CodeWave>

```xml
<sequence name="custom-sequence" 
  xmlns="http://ws.apache.org/ns/synapse">
  <log level="custom">
      <property 
        name="prop" 
        value="value-to-be-printed" 
      />
  </log>
</sequence>
```

All introduced custom API properties are stored and persisted inside the local `registry` of the API Manager. We are going to implement a mediation sequence to retrieve our `transparent-token` custom property from the local `registry` space of the API Manager. 

Since, our requirement is to only log the property, we are going to start implementing a custom mediation sequence with a simple log mediator.

```xml
<sequence name="custom-sequence" 
  xmlns="http://ws.apache.org/ns/synapse">
  <log level="custom">
      <property 
        name="prop" 
        expression="get-property('registry')" 
      />
  </log>
</sequence>
```

Change the log mediator to use `expression` in order to use the `get-property()` method to retrieve our custom API property. As the introduced custom property is available in the `registry` space, we are going to specify the scope of our `get-property()` with the `registry` scope.

```xml
fn:concat(
  'gov:/apimgt/applicationdata/provider/',
  $ctx:api.ut.apiPublisher, '/',
  $ctx:api.ut.api, '/',
  $ctx:api.ut.version, '/',
  'api@api_meta.transparent-token'
)
```

Now let's construct the registry path to access our `transparent-token` custom property. The registry path is constructed with the use of existing context properties. The `fn:concat` function is used to join the strings and the properties to build a complete registry path.

Following are the usages of the specified context properties

- `$ctx:api.ut.apiPublisher`: Publisher of the API
- `$ctx:api.ut.api`: API name
- `$ctx:api.ut.version`: API version

```xml
<sequence name="custom-sequence" 
  xmlns="http://ws.apache.org/ns/synapse">
  <log level="custom">
      <property 
        name="prop" 
        expression="get-property('registry', 
          fn:concat(
            'gov:/apimgt/applicationdata/provider/',
            $ctx:api.ut.apiPublisher, '/',
            $ctx:api.ut.api, '/',
            $ctx:api.ut.version, '/',
            'api@api_meta.transparent-token'
          ))"
      />
  </log>
</sequence>
```

We have now successfully developed a custom mediation sequence to retrieve our custom API property from the `registry` space and to print the value in the logs. 

Upload the sequence as an `in-mediation` sequence to the API from the Publisher portal and, Save and Publish, Invoke and check the logs.

</CodeWave>

Given below is the complete Synapse sequence (`in-sequence`), we developed to access our custom property named `transparent-token` from the local `registry` space of the API Manager.

```xml
<sequence name="custom-sequence" xmlns="http://ws.apache.org/ns/synapse">
  <log level="custom">
      <property 
        name="prop"
        expression="get-property('registry', 
          fn:concat(
            'gov:/apimgt/applicationdata/provider/',
            $ctx:api.ut.apiPublisher, '/',
            $ctx:api.ut.api, '/',
            $ctx:api.ut.version, '/',
            'api@api_meta.transparent-token'
          ))" />
  </log>
</sequence>
```
